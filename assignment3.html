    <h2 id="History"> History </h2>
      <p>   Sourdough Bread has first been dated back to the 3700 BCE and was excavated in Switzerland, however the origin of the Sourdough
      fermentation is originated from the agriculture from Egypt several thousand years earlier. </p>

      <p>   Sourdough remained the usual form of leavening down into the European Middle Ages until being replaced by barm from the beer brewing process, and after 1871 by purpose-cultured yeast. </p>

    <h2 id="Preparation"> Preparation </h2>
      <h3 id="Starter"> Starter </h3>
        <p> The preparation of sourdough begins with a pre-ferment (the "starter" or "leaven", also known as the "chief", "chef",
          "head", "mother" or "sponge"), a fermented mixture of flour and water, containing a colony of microorganisms including wild yeast and lactobacilli.
          The purpose of the starter is to produce a vigorous leaven and to develop the flavour of the bread. In practice there are several kinds of starters,
          as the ratio of water to flour in the starter (hydration) varies. A starter may be a liquid batter or a stiff dough. </p>

      <h3 id="Baking"> Baking </h3>
        <p> The starter must be fed 4 to 12 hours prior to being added to dough, by mixing flour and water
          to the starter. This creates an active leaven, which should grow in size and is ready to use when it is
          bubbly and floats in water. The leaven is mixed with flour and water to make a final dough of the desired consistency.
          The starter weight is usually 13% to 25% of the total flour weight, though formulas may vary. The dough is shaped into loaves,
          left to rise, and then baked. A number of 'no knead' methods are available for sourdough bread. Due to the length of time
          sourdough bread takes to proof, many bakers may refrigerate their loaves prior to baking. This process is known as 'retardation'
          to slow down the proofing process. This process has the added benefit of developing a richer flavoured bread. </p>
